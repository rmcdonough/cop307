AWS Event Engine allows AWS field teams to run Workshops, GameDays, Bootcamps, Immersion Days, and other events that require hands-on access to AWS accounts. Follow the steps below to gain access to your Event Engine AWS account.

Open a web browser and navigate to the Event Engine login page: [https://dashboard.eventengine.run](https://dashboard.eventengine.run). You will be presented with the terms and conditions login page.  Please read and understand the terms and conditions governing the use of Event Engine accounts.

After logging in, you will be redirected to the Team Dashboard. Set your team name if you like.  (We have enough accounts for participants to each have their own account, but all participants are welcome to form teams.)
