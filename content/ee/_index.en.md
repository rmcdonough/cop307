AWS Event Engine allows AWS field teams to run Workshops, GameDays, Bootcamps, Immersion Days, and other events that require hands-on access to AWS accounts. *Follow the steps below to gain access to your Event Engine AWS account*.

Open a web browser and navigate to the Event Engine login page: [https://dashboard.eventengine.run](https://dashboard.eventengine.run). You will be presented with the terms and conditions login page.  Please read and understand the terms and conditions governing the use of Event Engine accounts.

Event staff will provide you with a 12 digit team hash, if this is not already pre-populated in your web page. Use the 12 digit hash to log into the event.

After logging in, you will be redirected to the Team Dashboard. Today, each team will have a single person assigned to it, as these are individual lab activities.

Click the AWS Console link to login to the AWS account you’ll use for today’s event.

Those of you who are used to using the AWS CLI can copy environment variables directly into your terminal as well - or you can proceed entirely from the browser, depending on your comfort level.  <br/><br/>We will not be using CLI credentials in today's workshop. This workshop uses [Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) for its administrative environment.
