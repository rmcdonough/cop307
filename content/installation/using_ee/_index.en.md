The PetAdoptions application stack (along with the traffic generator) has automatically been deployed to your AWS Event Engine account. A Cloud9 environment has been provisioned for you as well. With clearance from event staff, you can proceed ahead to the modules specified by your instructor and begin exploring AWS Observability services and features.

* Note: Only a few modules require access to Cloud9. Your event instructor will inform you if Cloud9 is necessary for your workshop.

If Cloud9 is neccessary, visit the [Cloud9 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home#) and click `Open IDE` on the `observabilityworkshop` Cloud9 instance to access your Cloud9 environment as shown below.
