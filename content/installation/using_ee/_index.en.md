The PetAdoptions application stack (along with an included traffic generator, already running) has automatically been deployed to your AWS Event Engine account. A Cloud9 environment has been provisioned for you as well.

{{% notice tip %}}
Only a few modules require access to Cloud9. However, advanced users may wish to explore the environment further using Cloud9 as well.

Visit the [Cloud9 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home#) and click `Open IDE` on the `observabilityworkshop` Cloud9 instance to access your Cloud9 environment as shown below, and then proceed to the next step.
